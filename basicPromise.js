// Rewriting the hypothetical callback hell into promises
// Promises solves the inversion of control issue,
// but doesn't solve the pyramid of doom issue
// There is still chaining of then

const promise1 = api.createOrder(cart);

// Variable based promise chaining -> horizontal ðŸ¤¢
promise1.then((cost) => {
    promise2 = api.proceedPayment(cost);

    promise2.then(() => {
        promise3 = api.updateUI(cart);

        promise3.then(() => {
            api.StartShipping(cart, cost);
        })

    })
})

// Directly tying then without the need for a variable
// Chaining without variable is the best form of promise chaining
// This solves the horizontal chaining issue as it is now vertical chaining interms of readability

// When not using variable, return is must to included to return the promise to the next chain
api.createOrder(cart)
    .then((cost) => {
        return api.proceedPayment(cost);
    })
    .then((cost) => {
        return api.updateUI(cart, cost);
    })
    .then((cost) => {
        return api.StartShipping(cart, cost);
    })

// Kinda shortening it as for a single parameter, brackets is not requried
api.createOrder(cart)
    .then(cost => {
        return api.proceedPayment(cost);
    })
    .then(cost => {
        return api.updateUI(cart, cost);
    })
    .then(cost => {
        return api.StartShipping(cart, cost);
    })


// Shortening it
// This has automatic return
api.createOrder(cart)
    .then((cost) => api.proceedPayment(cost))
    .then ((cost) => updateUI(cart))
    .then((cost) => StartShipping(cart, cost));

// can be even more shortened by removing the input brackets of arrow functions
api.createOrder(cart)
    .then(cost => api.proceedPayment(cost))
    .then(cost => api.updateUI(cart))
    .then(cost => StartShipping(cart, cost));


// Real world example

const gitAPI = "https://api.github.com/users/kishorevb70"

// Fetch method returns a promise
const user = fetch(gitAPI);

// Promise { <pending> }
// Promise object contains pending 
console.log("Before resolving: ", user);

// Promise { <fulfilled>: Response }
// Promise object contains the appropriate information under the response object
user.then(() =>  console.log("After resolving: ", user) );

/*
##### Promises
- Most important topic in JS
- Promises evolved from callbacks
- Definition of `Promise`
	- **Object** representing the eventual completion or a failure of async operation
- The API's instead of calling the callback function and then returning the info, it will straight away return a **promise**
- Promise is an **object** which contains the return data of the API
- `Promise` object
	- Promise state
		- initially `pending`
		- `fulfilled` if resolved successfully
		- `rejected` if operation failed
	- Promise result
		- Initially `undefined`
		- `Response`  if fulfilled
- Initially the object would be pending
- After sometime, the data would be returned collected and the object would contain the appropriate data
- A callback function can be attached to the promise object which would be executed when the promise is **resolved**
	- The attachment is done through the `then` keyword
- Solving issues with the callback way
	1. Promises brings us back the control we lost when using vanilla callbacks
	2. Promises chained without the variable solve the pyramid of doom issue as they are chained vertically instead of horizontally
- Promises are **immutable** -> you can't change the resolved data by mistake
