### Functions in JS
<aside> ðŸ’¡ Functions are the heart of JS

</aside>
- Function Statement (or) Declaration
    - Creating a function â‡’ Function Statement
- Function Expression
    - Functions are assigned to variables
    - The major difference b/w expression and statement is Hoisting, functions are hoisted majava while variables are pucked up
    - code
	    ```jsx
	    let b = function (){
	    	console.log("This is b")
	    }
	    ```
- Anonymous Function
    - Function without a name
    - Anonymous - Similar to statement but does not have a name
    - Anonymous functions are used in place where the functions are plugged in as values
    - An anonymous function is often used in function expression
- Named Function Expression
    - In a function expression we use assign a function statement to the variable instead of an anonymous functions
- Parameters vs Arguments
    - Arguments are values that are passed in the function call
    - Parameters are local variables in the function - Label/Identifiers that get the values of arguments
- First Class Functions or First class citizens
	- It points to the ability of the function to be used as values and passed around
    - The ability to use functions as values - First Class functions
    - We can pass functions as arguments
    - We can also return a function from a function
